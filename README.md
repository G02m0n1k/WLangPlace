## How to use

After installing the script, a field will appear in your **profile**, as in the photo below  

<img src="docs/1.png" alt="s1" width="280px"><br>  
In this field you will need to enter the path to **your** RAW file with the custom translation.  

After that, you will need to click on the check mark to the right of the field. If everything went smoothly, the translation will be applied.  

<img src="docs/2.png" alt="s2" width="280px"><br>  

At the time of writing the instructions, a translation into [Russian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G02m0n1k/WLangPlace/refs/heads/main/langs-lib/russian.txt) is available, but you can also use your own translations :3  

If you want to remove the translation, leave the link field empty and click the check mark.  
The page will restart and the translation will disappear.


## Custom translation by yourself

Translating is quite simple!  

You need to select one of the files in [this folder](https://github.com/G02m0n1k/WLangPlace/tree/main/langs-lib).  

Then, use it as a template, where the <u>left part is the original phrase</u>, and the <u>right part is the text you translated</u>.  

**Please note that the files in the folder can be updated, since not all phrases may have been selected initially!**
